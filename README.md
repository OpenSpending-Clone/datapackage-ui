# Data Package Admin

A web app for creating, editing and validating Data Packages.

## Get Started

First, fork the code in GitHub.

```
# get the code
git clone https://github.com/{YOUR_USERNAME}/datapackagist.git .

# install the dependencies
npm install

# run the server
gulp

# deploy the app
gulp deploy

# run the tests
npm test
```

## Style guide

* Use 2 spaces for indentation

## Workflow

* Work in your own fork of the code, create branches for your work (as logical), and make pull requests for acceptance of tasks/issues.
* Prefer Git Flow conventions, so, for example: "feature/datapackage-form", and so on
